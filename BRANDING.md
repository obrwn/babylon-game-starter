# Branding and PWA configuration

Single source of truth for the loading screen, favicon, theme colors, and installable PWA manifest:

[`src/client/public/branding/config.json`](src/client/public/branding/config.json)

Fork authors edit this file and the assets under `public/branding/` to rebrand the game and satisfy browser install prompts. PWA service-worker code lives in the Vite build only and does **not** ship inside [`playground.json`](src/client/public/playground.json) — see [Playground isolation](#playground-isolation).

## Directory layout

```text
src/client/public/branding/
  config.json           ← loadscreen + PWA manifest metadata
  images/
    Babylon_logo.png    ← loading screen logo
    logo.png            ← favicon
  icons/                ← PWA install icons (192, 512, maskable)
  screenshots/          ← install dialog previews (wide + narrow) + og-card.png
```

Runtime loader: [`src/client/utils/branding_config.ts`](src/client/utils/branding_config.ts) (fetch once, apply loadscreen + `theme-color` meta).

Build-time manifest and social meta: [`vite.config.ts`](vite.config.ts) reads the same JSON via [`src/deployment/branding/load_branding_config.mjs`](src/deployment/branding/load_branding_config.mjs) and injects Open Graph / Twitter tags into `index.html` at build time (required for Discord, Slack, iMessage, and other crawlers that do not run JavaScript).

### Screenshot entries

Each item:

| Field | Example | Notes |
| ----- | ------- | ----- |
| `src` | `/branding/screenshots/desktop-wide.png` | Path under `public/` |
| `sizes` | `1280x720` | Must match actual PNG dimensions |
| `type` | `image/png` | MIME type |

---

## Social link previews

Open Graph and Twitter Card tags are written into **`dist/index.html` at build time**. Discord, Slack, iMessage, and similar crawlers read that static HTML — they do not run your app JavaScript.

### Where canonical URLs come from

At build time, [`vite.config.ts`](vite.config.ts) resolves absolute `og:url` and `og:image` from:

1. **`static.publicUrl`** in [`src/deployment/settings/settings.mjs`](src/deployment/settings/settings.mjs) (preferred), then
2. **`social.siteUrl`** in [`config.json`](src/client/public/branding/config.json) (fallback)

If neither is set, **`og:url` and absolute `og:image` / `twitter:image` are omitted** from the built HTML. Title, description, and other tags still render.

### Per-host `publicUrl` (deploy branches)

Each deployment target has its **own** `settings.mjs`. The [feature tag sync workflow](FEATURE_RELEASE.md) **preserves** those files on `gh-deploy`, `netlify-deployment`, and `render-deploy` — values you set on `main` or another branch do **not** automatically apply elsewhere.

Set `static.publicUrl` on **each branch you build and deploy** to that host's live URL (no trailing slash required):

| Host | Branch (typical) | Example `publicUrl` |
| ---- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| GitHub Pages (project site) | `gh-deploy` | `https://ericeisaman.github.io/babylon-game-starter` |
| Netlify | `netlify-deployment` | `https://your-site.netlify.app` |
| Render (web service SPA) | `render-deploy` | `https://your-service.onrender.com` |

Example (`gh-deploy` / GitHub Pages):

```js
static: {
  basePath: '/babylon-game-starter/',
  publicUrl: 'https://ericeisaman.github.io/babylon-game-starter'
}
```

Example (Netlify or Render at site root):

```js
static: {
  basePath: '/',
  publicUrl: 'https://your-site.netlify.app'
}
```

After editing settings on a deploy branch, rebuild and redeploy. Validate locally with `npm run social:test`.

### Branding-only fallback

If you cannot set `publicUrl` on a deploy branch yet, add **`social.siteUrl`** to `config.json` with your primary public demo URL. That applies to **every** build that uses that branding file — use it only when one canonical URL is correct for all hosts, or as a temporary fallback.

---

## Rebranding walkthrough

1. Replace `public/branding/images/logo.png` and `Babylon_logo.png`.
2. Edit `public/branding/config.json` (title, colors, PWA name, paths).
3. Regenerate PWA icons and screenshots:

   ```sh
   npm run generate:pwa-assets
   ```

4. Build and preview:

   ```sh
   npm run build && npm run preview
   ```

5. Validate installability and social previews:

   ```sh
   npm run pwa:test
   npm run social:test
   ```

## PWA install assets

| Asset | Size | Purpose |
| ----- | ---- | ------- |
| `icon-192.png` | 192×192 | Install icon, apple-touch-icon |
| `icon-512.png` | 512×512 | Install icon |
| `icon-512-maskable.png` | 512×512 (safe zone) | Android adaptive icon |
| `desktop-wide.png` | 1280×720 | Install dialog screenshot (desktop) |
| `mobile-narrow.png` | 390×844 | Install dialog screenshot (mobile) |
| `og-card.png` | 1200×630 | Open Graph / Twitter Card preview image |

`npm run generate:pwa-assets` derives icons from `logo.png`, screenshots and `og-card.png` from [`resources/Babylon_Game_Starter_Banner.jpg`](resources/Babylon_Game_Starter_Banner.jpg).

## Runtime behavior

- **Cache strategy:** CacheFirst (local-first) for static assets, branding files, GitHub-hosted models, and Babylon CDN scripts. Configured in [`vite.config.ts`](vite.config.ts).
- **Updates:** When a new build deploys, a versioned service worker waits in the background. **Settings → Update App** applies the update.
- **Purge:** **Settings → Purge Cache** clears all caches, unregisters the service worker, and reloads.
- **Registration:** [`src/client/pwa/pwa_client.ts`](src/client/pwa/pwa_client.ts), wired from [`src/client/main.ts`](src/client/main.ts) only.

### iPad Safari install (Share → Add to Home Screen)

iPadOS Safari does **not** support Chrome’s automatic install prompt. This starter implements the recommended coach pattern:

- **iOS meta tags** — `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, `apple-mobile-web-app-title`, `apple-touch-icon` (set in [`branding_config.ts`](src/client/utils/branding_config.ts)).
- **Repeat-visit coach** — After the second visit in Safari on iPad (not already installed), a modal explains: *Tap Share → Add to Home Screen*.
- **Settings → Install App** — On iPad Safari, opens the Share → Add to Home Screen coach modal. On Chromium (desktop/Android), triggers the browser’s native install prompt directly.

Logic lives in [`src/client/utils/pwa_install_coach.ts`](src/client/utils/pwa_install_coach.ts) (playground-safe). Chromium capture is wired from [`src/client/pwa/pwa_install.ts`](src/client/pwa/pwa_install.ts) in `main.ts` only.

### Playground isolation

The Babylon Playground export uses [`src/client/utils/pwa_runtime.ts`](src/client/utils/pwa_runtime.ts) stubs — no `pwa/` imports, no `workbox-window`. [`scripts/check-playground-export.mjs`](scripts/check-playground-export.mjs) fails if bundled code imports `pwa/`. The service worker excludes `playground.json` from precache.

---

## Validation

```sh
npm run social:test
```

Runs `npm run build`, validates Open Graph / Twitter meta tags in static `dist/index.html`, starts `vite preview`, and checks tags with Playwright plus OG image HTTP availability.

```sh
npm run pwa:test
```

Runs `npm run build`, validates `config.json` and `dist/` artifacts, starts `vite preview`, and runs Lighthouse PWA installability audits (`installable-manifest`, `service-worker`, `works-offline`, `maskable-icon`).

---

## Deployment

Branding paths are relative to the Vite **`base`** URL (same as the rest of the static site). If favicon or loading-screen assets 404 after deploy, verify **`static.basePath`** in [`src/deployment/settings/settings.mjs`](src/deployment/settings/settings.mjs) matches the live URL.

For **social link previews**, set **`static.publicUrl`** on each deployment branch you ship — see [Social link previews](#social-link-previews).
